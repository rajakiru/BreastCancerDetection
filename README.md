# BreastCancerDetection

The breast cancer dataset is a classic and very easy binary classification dataset. It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass and describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

In our dataset we have the outcome variable or Dependent variable i.e Y having only two set of values, either M (Malign) or B(Benign). So we will use Classification algorithm of supervised learning.

The following are the list of algorithms we use:
Logistic Regression
Nearest Neighbor
Support Vector Machines
Kernel SVM
Na√Øve Bayes
Decision Tree Algorithm
Random Forest Classification
